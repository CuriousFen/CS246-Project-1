        <h2>About Cat Cafés</h2>
        <p>
            A cat café is a relaxing space where visitors can enjoy coffee or tea while
            spending time with friendly cats. These cafés provide a calm environment that helps
            people unwind and brings joy through the company of cats.
        </p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
            Guests can sit in a warm, quiet area filled with cats that roam freely.
            Many cat cafés feature cozy seating, gentle music, and light refreshments.
            Visitors are welcome to read, study, or simply relax while the cats
            nap beside them or play nearby.
        </p>
